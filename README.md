# HELLO RUST

Running the Rust hello world program using the ferris-says crate.

Despite the instructions on [Getting Started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), on 8/24/2023, you need to install ferris_says 0.3.1 (NOT 0.2).

Either insert the dependency directly in the cargo.toml or run...
`cargo add ferris-says@0.3.1`

Hopefully deciding to finally dive in with rust isn't a mistake for a pythonista like myself.
